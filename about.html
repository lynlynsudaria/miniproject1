               <h5> Skin Whitening, Skin Care, Beauty Products and more</h5><br>
                <p> Queen Beauty is an online shop that provides trending beauty products and skin care products such as <br>
                    lip tint, face mask, collagen, moisturizer, pimple remover and underarm whitening to name a few. <br>
                    We started distributing our beauty products within Northern Mindanao area such as Bukidnon,
                    Valencia City, Malaybalay City and Cagayan de Oro City, etc. and grew it from there serving most areas in the Philippines.</p> <br>
                    <p>As a Filipina owned online shop, we saw the need to solve common skin care and beauty problems<br>
                        that haunts and bothers Filipino teens and adults. We have various solutions to
                        these problems such as pimple remover, hair care products, eye bag remover, skin whitening, <br>
                        underarm whitening and more. We can relate to those problems because at some point we have been bothered by those as well.<br>
                        Most of the products on our shop are used by the management and staff of Queenbeauty.ph and hope our experience with the 
                        product would help other people as well.</p> <br>
